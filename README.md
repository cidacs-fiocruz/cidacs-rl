# CidacsRL

## What is it?

This is the repository code of CidacsRL,
a Record Linkage tool built to link data from Brazillian goverment to enhance them to be used on health ressearch.

## Aims

Due to the explosion on the amount of data generated by EHR and Administrative systems,
current tools for Record Linkage in Brazil are sometimes incapable of linking whole databases.

Thus, our main goals are to:

- Have a easy to use RL system (the ressearcher should be able to setup and run the software within a day).
- Be fast and scalable (the system will link most a pair of most databases available in Brazil within a week on a small server).
- Implement the state of the art RL aproaches.
